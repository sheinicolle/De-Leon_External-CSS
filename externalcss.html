<h2>BEHIND</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I worked for a long time, but it was the first time I had ever seen a group like this. 
What SEVENTEEN always says is 'You can really work hard as much as you practice'. That’s why the teamwork is so good, and it’s a group that always works really hard.” 
Pledis Performance Directing Team Manager Yoon Hye-rim said while explaining why Seventeen's performance is bound to be outstanding. 
Although they have performed numerous stages so far, all of Seventeen's performances contain the sincerity and efforts of the members and staff. 
Yoon Hye-rim, team leader, said, “At a concert, when the staff organizes everything from the VCR to the set list and briefs them, the members tend to express their opinions a lot, 
and at the end of the meeting, we go through the final revision process. This setlist was also completed with half and half ideas from the staff and members. 
I think the most enjoyable performance comes out when the members do the performance they want to do, so I listen to the opinions of the members almost 100 percent and make adjustments,” he explained about the performance planning process.</p>

It is a performance that contains The 'BE THE SUN' concert shows the image of 'Seventeen who became the sun', and the repackage album later contains the story of Seventeen warming the world with the energy of the sun. 
Team leader Lee Hyo-jin said, "This Seoul concert was held between Seventeen's 4th full-length album and the repackage album preparation process, so we had to manage a really tight schedule. 
So, the staff suggested that it would be better to prepare only for the main songs of the regular album and plan the next concert, but the members were rather greedy and said that they wanted to show various stages to fans they hadn't seen in a while, so the songs were better. added,” he said. 
For example, in the case of 'Shadow', which was first released at the Seoul concert, it was added to the setlist with the members' opinions, and 'March', which is also a song that contains Seventeen's narrative, was also prepared in a tight schedule to show fans a new look. 
The explosive response to the Seoul concert can be said to be the result.
